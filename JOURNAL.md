# July 28th: Brainstorming and coming up with ideas

- Worked on brainstorming idea and witaching a bunch of videos
- Link for one of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XLd9gztQko&ab_channel=GaelLEVEL
- Saw different ideas with poster baord backing, acrylic backing, and plywood backing
- Probably poster board backing is going to work the best
- Thinking to make about 30" x 24" or something similar
- Aiming for this to be a 4 point project so around $50 in budget
- Still figuring out also waht type of led lights to use

**Total time spent: 1.5h**
